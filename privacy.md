# Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** September 7, 2025  
**Last updated:** September 7, 2025

## 1. Scope
This Privacy Policy describes how **EquiBill** collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our mobile application and related services.

## 2. Information we collect
**Information you provide:**
- Account information: email, full name (up to 24 chars), password (handled by our auth provider).
- Profile & House info: your house membership (one house at a time), your display name, and the member list visible to house members.
- Expense data: titles, optional descriptions, amounts (> 0), participants, and paid status.
- Device tokens for push: platform (iOS/Android) and Expo push token (to deliver nudges).
- Support requests or feedback you send us.

**Information we collect automatically:**
- App activity logs (e.g., when nudges are sent; one per 24h per expense/person).
- Device info (model, OS version) and diagnostics or crash logs if you opt in, to improve stability and performance.
- Approximate location only if derived from your device locale/timezone (we do not collect precise GPS).

We do **not** collect financial account numbers, government IDs, or sensitive biometric data.

## 3. How we use information
We use your information to:
- Provide and maintain the App (auth, houses, expenses, nudges).
- Enforce rules (e.g., one house per user, member limit of 8, nudge throttle).
- Send transactional push notifications (nudges and relevant updates).
- Improve, troubleshoot, and secure the App (debugging, analytics, preventing abuse).
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.

**Legal bases:** contract necessity (to provide the App), legitimate interests (security, improvement, anti-abuse), consent (push notifications and any optional analytics), and legal obligation.

## 4. Sharing of information
We share information with:
- Service providers that help us operate the App (e.g., cloud hosting, authentication, push messaging). This includes providers like Supabase (backend hosting/auth/database) and Expo (push messaging).
- Other users in your house (they can see your name and the expenses you participate in).
- Authorities, if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property.
- Business transfers (e.g., merger, acquisition), subject to this Policy.

We do **not** sell your personal information.

## 5. International transfers
We may process and store information in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) for cross-border transfers.

## 6. Data retention
We retain information for as long as your account is active and as necessary to provide the App. When you delete your account, we delete your profile, device tokens, and any expenses you created or participated in, and remove you from your House (if it becomes empty, it is deleted). We may retain limited logs for a reasonable period for security, fraud prevention, or legal compliance.

## 7. Your choices & rights
- **Account deletion:** You can request account deletion from within the App.
- **Push notifications:** You can enable/disable via device settings at any time.
- **Access/Rectification/Erasure:** Where applicable, you may request access, correction, deletion, or portability of your data, or object/restrict certain processing.
- **Do Not Track:** We currently do not respond to DNT signals.

To exercise rights, contact us at **equibillapp@gmail.com**.

## 8. Childrenâ€™s privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the age of digital consent in your region). If we learn that we collected personal data from a child under that age, we will delete it.

## 9. Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect your information (e.g., access controls, encryption in transit, least-privilege practices with our providers). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 10. Third-party links and services
The App may link to third-party sites or services. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.

## 11. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will notify you (e.g., in-app or by email) and update them.
