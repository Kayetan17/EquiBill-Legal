**Last updated:** September 7, 2025

## 1. Who we are
EquiBill is a student-run project dedicated to making splitting expenses between housemates effortless and efficient. The app is provided free of charge and maintained by a small independent team.

## 2. What EquiBill does
EquiBill allows users to join a “house” with their housemates, and allows house members to create expenses between themselves. The app keeps track of whether or not people have paid and gives the expense owner the opportunity to nudge those who haven’t, sending them a notification.

## 3. Eligibility & accounts
- You must be at least 13 years old (or older if your local law requires).
- You must provide accurate information (e.g., your full name and email).
- You are responsible for your account, your device, and safeguarding your login.
- You may belong to only one house at a time. If you leave, you can join a different house later.

## 4. Acceptable use
You agree not to:
- Use the App for unlawful purposes or to harass, spam, or impersonate others.
- Attempt to probe, scan, or test the App or its infrastructure without authorization, or disrupt or overload the service.
- Circumvent or tamper with security controls.  
We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

## 5. Expenses; no financial advice
EquiBill is a coordination tool. We do not move money, process payments, or provide legal, tax, financial, or accounting advice. Any settlements between users happen outside the App and are your responsibility.  
Each participant can be nudged at most once every 24 hours per expense. You can disable notifications in your device settings at any time.

## 6. Privacy
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your information. By using the App, you consent to the practices described there.

## 7. Intellectual property; license to you
We own the App and all related intellectual property. Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on your personal device.

## 8. Your content; license to us
You retain rights to the content you submit (e.g., expense titles/descriptions). You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, and display your content solely to operate and improve the App.

## 9. Third-party services
EquiBill relies on third-party providers to operate (e.g., authentication, hosting, and push messaging). Your use of those services may be subject to their separate terms and privacy policies.

## 10. App stores; device requirements
If you download the App from the Apple App Store, you agree to the Apple Media Services Terms and Apple’s Standard EULA. Apple and Google are not responsible for providing support for the App. You are responsible for data charges and compatible hardware.

## 11. Changes to the service
We may add, modify, or remove features, and may suspend or discontinue the App in whole or in part. Where required, we will provide reasonable notice.

## 12. Termination
You may stop using the App at any time. You may request deletion of your account within the App. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or we’re required to by law. Upon termination, provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g., disclaimers, limitations of liability) will survive.

## 13. Disclaimers
THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not guarantee the App will be uninterrupted or error-free.

## 14. Limitation of liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP.

## 15. Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold EquiBill and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the App or your violation of these Terms.

## 16. Governing law; venue; disputes
These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, without regard to conflicts of law rules.

## 17. Changes to these Terms
We may update these Terms. If changes are material, we will provide notice by email, in-app, or by updating the effective date.
